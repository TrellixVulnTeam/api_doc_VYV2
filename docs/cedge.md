# Chrysalis Cloud Video-Edge-AI-Proxy

The ultimate video pipeline for Computer Vision. The video-edge-ai-proxy ingests multiple RTSP camera streams and provides a common interface for conducting AI operations on or near the Edge.

The video-edge-ai-proxy is an easy to use collection mechanism from multiple cameras onto a single more powerful computer. For example, a network of CCTV RTSP enabled cameras can be accessed through a simple GRPC interface, where Machine Learning algorithms can do various Computer Vision tasks. Furthermore, interesting footage can be annotated, selectively streamed and stored through a simple API for later analysis, computer vision tasks in the cloud or enriching the Machine Learning training samples.
